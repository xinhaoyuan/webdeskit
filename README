Version 0.1

Weblet is a minimalistic launcher based on WebKitGtk, Html and C
native plugins.  Feel free to hack it as well as adding new features.

BTW: Currently the script wrapper uses socat for sending WakeUp signal
remotely, so socat is required too.


# Compile 

Current it works (at least I used it in my production environment).
But the code is dirty, the layout is unstable and may still contain
some bugs.

To compile and use it, you need my compile framework
(http://github.com/xinhaoyuan/works).  Put this project directory to
works/prj/ and link the layout file (desc) to works/desc/weblet.  Then
do make commands in the works/ directory.

``make weblet-debug'' will make the project and create a debugging
instance, everytime you press enter key will send the wakeup signal to
the launcher.

``make weblet-install'' will install the ``weblet'' command into
~/bin.


# Use

Assuming you have done make weblet-install and everything goes
fine. You can bind any key you want in your window manager to run the
``weblet'' command, to start or wakeup the WebLet instance. It will
show a black command console in the middle of current screen. You can
type command in it. Press enter to launch the command you typed.


# Features list

 - auto-complete filenames in $PATH for the first command argument.

 - recognize web address in the first command argument and will open
   x-www-browser for it.

 - using ``#'' as the first argument will enter the JavaScript Eval
   mode. You can type any javascript in the second argument box. Press
   ``Tab'' to eval it.
